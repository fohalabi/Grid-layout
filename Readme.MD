# CSS Grid Layout Project

A simple project demonstrating CSS Grid layout techniques with a centered, multi-row, multi-column grid structure.

## Project Overview

This layout uses CSS Grid to arrange 10 boxes in a custom structure, with each box placed precisely using grid templates. The grid container is centered within the browser window.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (CSS Grid)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fohalabi/css-grid-layout.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd css-grid-layout
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in a web browser**:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

## Customization

You can modify the grid layout by editing the CSS file (`style.css`). Key customizations include:

- Changing the number of columns or rows (`grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`).
- Adjusting the placement of specific grid items by modifying `grid-colums` and `grid-row`.
- Adding or removing items as needed.
